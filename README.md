# Multilevel-Methods-for-Diffusions-of-observed-Marked-Point-Processes
This file is comprised of several .py files that include the definition of the functions, test files, and one file used for parallelization in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and additionally there are jupyter notebooks that include some examples that go throught most of the process of finding the hyperparameters for the algorithms and display some of the results of the project. The definition of the functions for the single particle filter is in 
PF_functions_def.py (here are also the functions to estimate the score function with the smoother and compute the SGA), the coupling of the filter and the functions for the MLPF and the unbiased particle filter are in Un_cox_PF_functions_def.py. In both PF_functions_def.py and Un_cox_PF_functions_def.py there is a small description of the functions included in the files at the beginning of the document. 
in 1Parallelization_Cox_PF.py we adapt the code to parallelize it; finally, the rest of the functions are test functions for the four diffusion processes tested. The functions where files are defined are documented and described at the beginning of the files, several tests of the basic functions are also included (commented).
